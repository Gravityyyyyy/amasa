It is a bit heavy and it took a bit to get used to.

Easy to import all of my contacts, apps, photo's & files. It took some time using the smart swith app for Android as I had thousands of photos but was all done in the app. It's much faster than the S9 but the easy to use of the android system. It is totally unlocked as advertised and connected to the Verizon network right away. FYI: get a new sim card rather than using your old phones existing sim card. The only issue I ran into was by using my S9 sim card it was registered to the old phone and discovered it was in the new S23fe which it didn't like. It stopped communicating with verizon. The techs at verizon fixed everything quickly and it now works perfectly all at no charge! The camera portion of the phone takes ok selfies and basic photographs. The zoom feature came out a little blurry. Not the best camera setup but the phone/texting and all apps function as desired. All in all I'm totally satisfied with the newest Galaxy model plus saved over $100 by purchasing online. Samsung quality."

We received the original order quickly, charged it and started the set up. The phone needed a PIN to log in and set up. We thought this was unusual for a new phone. Started a chat session w/Amazon Help Desk and w/in 5 minutes was told that it appeared to have been used by a customer, returned the item and we ended up receiving it in error.We were offered the return option so that we could purchase another one. We initiated the return process and mailed it out the next day.The return message on my Amazon account stated that we would be refunded when they received the device. I have been monitoring my emails and still have not received any notice or tracking info.I checked the tracking number thru UPS and it shows that the device was received 2 days ago.I logged into my Amazon account and the Refund Status shows the same info but I am not scheduled for my $500+ refund until more than 2 weeks away. Why would it take that long and why would they indicate that my refund would be issued upon their receipt? Very frustrating!The new device was easy to set up, long lasting battery, superb camera."

The phone was unopened and in its original package, cellophane wrapped and factory fresh. It's in tip-top shape, clean, sharp, and practically perfect with a pretty purple shine. I'm impressed with how well-made it is, and it's fairly priced too - way less expensive than the flagship.The phone comes with a SIM slot key and a C-to-C cable. However, I'm not sure if it has an expandable memory slot. At the moment, it doesn't seem to have a keyhole for the memory slot, but it does have one for the SIM slot. I also purchased a protective case separately, which is clear, decent, and fits well in my hand and pocket. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a high-quality device at a reasonable price."

So far, it's been very good for the price. The chipset is simply blazing fast. Everything feels snappy on this phone. Opening and closing apps are quick. Animation is smooth and does not stutter. The build quality is amazing and feels good to touch. So good that I did not use case until I first dropped it (more on this later).One drawback this phone has is battery life. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry. The battery, while theoretically big, is quickly depleted. I mostly use my phone for navigation (Android Auto wireless), YouTube video playback, browsing on Edge, or social media chatting. My Screen on Time (SoT) life is expected to be 7 hours when fully charged according to AccuBattery Pro app I installed since day one of owning this phone. That is my usage without gaming ever. Expect the battery life to go down to around 4 hours or even less if you game because gaming is extremely taxing on your phone. It also heats up quite quickly, probably because it's drawing a bit too much power than it should have (inefficient CPU / GPU). One solution I have working for me is by activating Light performance profile under Device Care settings. This decrease the performance unless you're gaming. For my use case, it's perfect because it doesn't overheat anymore. That 7 hours SoT figure is with this profile turned on. Expect it to be around 5.5 to 6 hours SoT without this on.So about me dropping the phone, it was when I was changing my car's tires. I was crouching, so when it fell, it was about 12 inches high. The floor was concrete, and it was not clean. This is the worst combination because dust and debris are really abrasive and can easily put lots of dents and scratches on phone. Surprisingly, other than two scratches (one big, and one small), there's really no other damage. I was using matte screen protector at that time, so when it ended up falling screen down, it did crack the screen protector, but the screen remains flawless to this day. I assumed it fell by its side frame (charging port side), then it fell face down. I did attach the photo so you can judge the amount of damage done by this accident."
,5,Excellent phone,Fantastic camera and screen quality. Really liked the zoom
,5,Spectrum phone Service Provider,"Just to begin, the phone is awesome. Be carefully with what phone service provider you want to use the phone with. SPECTRUM is a pain in the a$$. I went to the store with this ""3rd party phone"". They said that the phone is NOT compatible with Spectrum's system. I know... it is unlocked and should work on any provider. In essence, if you didn't buy it here, we won't put it on our system. Don't give up. Leave the store and call ""611"". For some ungodly reason, the managent won't let the stores put phones not purchased with Spectrum on their system. Call 611."
,5,Yes!,"We got this for my son, and so far it has worked out amazing. This one doesn't break as easily as all of the others he has had. If you add a case your really covered good! This phone is very user friendly, inexpensive, and the battery lasts a long time. The fingerprint sensor works perfect."
,4,"IT'S WAS OK,GRACIAS.",ME GUSTÓ. ME GUSTARIA COMPRARLE UNA GARANTIA.
,4,Great so far!,"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a block, and the charger it comes with could be significantly better otherwise; it seems to be an amazing phone off the rip. I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be ""unlocked"" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped! (Make sure to select the version that comes with the free $100 Amazon gift card while it lasts)💪🏽"
,5,Quiero uno para mi,Se lo regale a mi parejaY yo ahora tengo envidiaPero no me puedo gastar todos los días ese dineroMe gusta mucho es bueno
,5,Just want my wife wanted!,Uncomplicated and the right size for her hands. It has the features that my wife would normally use. She loves the Galaxy S 23 FE
,5,Great phone,I am forever married to Samsung Galaxies all the way. To me they are the best and last the longest
,4,Not bad,"Battery life is good, calls are clear, I have no issues with heat or the processor.The screen could be better my old s8 was 564pi, the s23fe is lower around 403.Buy a case."
,4,Prefer my Motorola,I got this phone supposedly because of its high rating. And I am very disappointed in it. I do not like the Text-to-speech on my messenger. It doesn't pick up all the words correctly. It doesn't have the bells and whistles like my Motorola phone had. I'm stuck with it now for a couple of years UNFORTUNATELY.The only thing I like better is the camera feature.
,5,Good smartphone overall,Happy with my purchase good value for money.
,5,S23fe,Great photos as always.
,5,Good buy!,"I was skeptical buying a phone online without looking at it, but I'm really glad I took the chance. The camera and photos are great, battery life is great, speed and space is good. I honestly have no complaints!"
,5,recieved,"I love it! i have boost and i boufht this because i nweded a new phone switching over phones was easy amd transferring all my info was also super explainatory! so far i love it, i listen to music all day dueing work and my battery has been great! i also ordered mine with the galaxy headphones and i love love them! def worth the purchase."
,5,Very good Purchase,I bought this phone as a gift for my wife.She liked it. So far so good it has been serving its purpose and she’s happy because she’s really in love with Samsung phones.
,4,"Well done, in my opinion","The black Friday deal was definitely worth it. It's a great phone, especially if you're looking for an affordable upgrade. Feels premium and not too costly to obtain. The cameras & battery life are great. What I like most is that its not ""curved"" but actually square with smooth edges- its easy to hold and grip. It's easy to interact with, up to date, transferring everything is simple. Very similar in size to a S22+, the weight may seem heavy to some. I appreciate how this was made. The only con is it comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning you have to buy a USB-C charger cube/box if you don't already have one since it's a USB-C type of charger. If you're used to the older charger types you can easily find a cable that connects to the charger cube/box but has a USB-C end on the other end of the charger."
,5,Great phone,Very easy to activate and use. It is beautiful. A huge upgrade from my Samsung A32 and cheaper than buying it from mobile
,3,No video calling with Verizon,"I have had the phone for a month. I loved everything about it until I realized I didn't have a video call option. I called Verizon and after an hour with them troubleshooting, I was transferred to Samsung who basically said, video calling on Samsungs with verizon are only available if you purchase the phone through verizon. So if this is a feature you use often, you will want to go through verizon not Amazon. Super annoying. My husband's unlocked Google Pixel has it, I probably should have gone with that."
,5,It's better than my iphone11 !,"I was always a android person and never dissatisfied with samsung phones but on day i wanted to act cool an switch to iPhone which is very overrated nowadays. This phone is awesome and I had no issues transferring my Metro PCS by T Mobile. Phone came in original packaging doesn't seem used and the great thing is I got it on sale and if I want I can upgrade to the new Samsung S24 and pay cheaper. I love the amount of space it comes with , I love the texting buttons and picture quality. I just got this phone and I'm very happy that I've just been moving everything from my iPhone to this new phone quickly. It's actually a little bigger too . Samsung I will never leave you again ! The only thing I notice is the face recognition isn't all that great like iPhone but at least you have the option to do thumb print and you can copy all your fingers just in case face isn't doing it . Love my phone!"
,5,Great pics,"This was a deal @ 399 on Black Friday 128 gb version. I did purchase the 25 watt charger, so that was an extra 15 bucks. Others that say the battery life is bad are probably wrong, mine is great. I live in a poor cell reception area, so I have wifi calling enabled. Assuming that is also their problem, when you have poor signal, it will drain your battery because it is working harder searching for signal constantly. My area is bad for all carriers. I have T-mobile prepaid which is better than anything else in my area. Easy switch, transfer files and just insert old phone sim card into new phone and restart. This was a replacement for a 5yr olda20 that I recently dropped and broke the screen. No complaints and have had it for about a month now. Fast USA model. Shipped and sold by Amazon. Also grabbed a Ringke Onyx case which is pretty good, very tight and military grade drop protection. This thing is waterproof also up to 30 minutes submerged in 4 ft of water..go see for yourself on Youtube. Won't do this with mine but good to know. 30 times zoom pics are better than I thought they would be, especially moon."
,5,"Feels Heavy, but solid","It's heavier and a bit thicker than my Moto G which I had to replace due to broken screen. Wasn't worth fixing. It feels solid, dropped a couple of times and it survived, thankfully. Picture quality is awesome.Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth.Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird.Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt."
,4,S23 FE,Esta bastante bien lo único que no me gusto es que la batería no le dura casi
,4,Great budget phone,"I bought this on Black Friday for $400 and at that price the S23 FE is definitely worth it. The Snapdragon processor can definitely keep up with the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 Hz. This phone can handle most games you throw at it without a noticeable drop in FPS. The camera is sharper compared to Samsung's A series line. The smaller battery is noticeable here so expect to charge your phone more often but it does support 25W fast charging. This phone does get warm after prolong and extensive use but I use a phone case so it doesn't bother me. There is no headphone jack, no charging block included, or expandable storage which stops it from being 5 stars. Overall though, this is a great budget phone if you don't want to pay flagship prices but still get 80% of the features of a flagship phone."
,4,Great phone and support,Purchased the phone a month ago.Initially had a problem with the settings.Called the tech support number and the issue was resolved immediately.Defintely great service from a company that stands behind their product.
,5,Great phone easy to use.,Ease of use.
,5,Great phone,Everything was a great as expected. I love that Amazon will let you make payments without robbing you.
,3,The Battery Life Is Very Disappointing,"Overall, the phone is average, but the battery life is very disappointing. I've searched online, and other people have the same issue. It is apparently due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 (SM8450) being terrible for battery life. Even the normal Samsung Galaxy S23 phones (which were released before the Galaxy S23 FE) use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen2 (SM8550), which is insanely better. Why they didn't decide to use it on this phone (which is newer) is beyond me. It was a terrible mistake on Samsung's part, in my opinion. There's no excuse for using a 2-year-old processor from your S22 lineup for a phone that was just released. Having a 4500mAh battery means nothing when the power-hungry CPU is sucking the life out of it. The battery of my 8-year-old Samsung Galaxy S9 is comparable to this phone, which is new out of the box and fully charged with dark mode and a dim screen. You are better off buying a phone with a processor that doesn't suck the battery life out of it like a vampire. Cheaping out and having such poor battery life is unacceptable in 2024."
,4,Love it,"I love this phone. But I dropped 1 star because on the regular texting app, they got rid of the delivered/read receipt and also the video calling like the Galaxy 8 and 9 has (our old phones).The size is great and love how the fingerprint is on the front screen. So far, so good!"
,5,Really worth the price,"I'm currently using this phone as of typing this review and so far there is no issues with this phone and its worth the price when it's on sale for less than $500 it handles really well with gaming and pictures so this makes it worth the price. I can game at 120 fps and experience a 120 refresh rate and it feels like a powerful phone for this price. So if your in the market of finding a budget phone for at least $500, get this phone while it's on sale. You won't regret it"
,5,Fabulous upgrade from Galaxy A52.,"My A52 was getting a bit old and had limited updates to the OS.I decided to splurge and get something close to a premium version just to see what it was like and if it was worth the extra money.I'm not a power user and seldom take advantage of the camera, but in general I found the S23 FE to be a significant improvement over the A52.It has all the features I wanted in waterproofing, wireless charging, 5G, etc., but the think I like most is the display.The colors on a black background just pop out at you."
,5,All good and a very good price.,"Upgraded from a S9+, so this is a noticeable improvement for a very good price."
,5,Fine phone,Faster along with more memory.
,4,Not worth the price,"I am not impressed.I had the Galaxy S20 FE.My son has it now.There is literally not enough difference between the 2.I have learned my lesson. I will basically run this one into the ground before I ""upgrade"" again.The battery life on my brand new phone is no better than my 2 year old S20 FE.Perhaps the camera is better. I cannot really tell."
,4,"Buen precio, grandes marcos","Es un gran teléfono, cumplidor. Tiene una cámara que no te dejará decepcionado (considerando el precio), un rendimiento balanceado, una buena pantalla pero con grandes marcos. Respecto al desbloqueo por huella dactilar debo de decir que es por lo menos mejorable, ¿es bueno? Si, pero relativamente lento, nada molesto pero si se ve que en eso hubo un recorte. La duración de la batería no es tan buena, pero cumple para salir de casa y volver con un 20%. Dejando todo eso de lado, es muy bonito y cómodo a la mano, su tamaño es bastante agradable estando en ese tamaño medio entre el s23 y el s23+."
,5,Great Price,"Like new. Works perfectly, saved a bundle."
,5,Great phone,"Great camera, Great performance overall"
,5,Amazing,So far so good! Bought this unlocked phone after my old phone crapped out and straighttalk was charging a couple hundred more for the same phone. Works amazing! Only bad part is I had to buy a wall box because it only comes with a cord and is a c end on both ends of the cord.
,4,Great phone with a horrible battery,"This phone is fast and the camera is the best I have had, however, it runs out of battery just sitting there overnight. I don't know if I got a dud battery or a returned phone, but it is horrible. I have never had a phone with such a bad battery right out of the box."
,5,Impresionante,Es un teléfono realmente bueno es rápido y lo que más me impresiono el la calidad de imagen tanto que lo utilizo como una wwbcam para mis videos ya que tiene mucha más resolución que una webcam
,5,Long battery life and awesome night time cameras and stuff.,"Like everything. It's better than crapple iphones, they suck."
,4,Pretty cool,I like it.
,5,Excellent,Phone was a little thicker than I thought it would be but overall it's lovely excellent photos and many editing options long battery life.. can last for 2days with average use. Face recognition doesnt work well but finger print is excellent Overall I'm happy
,4,Very nice,Needed a new up to date phone. So far so good. Does everything that I was looking for from my “helpers“ in choosing.
,4,Decent but not great,"Wish I had my S21 back.The S23FE is useless without a case -- very slippery, uncomfortable to hold, and the camera lenses keep it from sitting flat."
,3,Very good phone but NOT 100 PERCENT COMPATIBLE WITH COMCAST NETWORK !!!NO VOICE MAIL.,"I bought my 23 FE near the end of 2023, and was very happy with it till recently.I originally went to the Comcast store, and had them do a SIM swap from my previous phone.All was OK till about a month ago, when I realized I had not been receiving voicemails.I was told that this phone (unless bought from Comcast) is NOT 100 percent compatible with their network, and that some features would stop working after a while.This is exactly what happened to me.So, if the ability to receive voicemail is important to you, do NOT buy this phone if you plan on usingit on the Comcast network."
,5,Love it so far,"Just received my S23 FE today and it's great so far, the camera is wonderful, the fingerprint scanner works great for me even after putting a screen protector on, it's fast, my At&t Sim card worked no problem, there has been no issued with the phone so far ,great choice!"
,5,MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS PHONE!,He was so happy when i bought it for our wedding anniversary. He said the phone was fast and packed well. I bought a brand new one and the brand new is legit! Loved it. Thank u
,5,90 percent improvement over A53 5G!,"Geekbench CPU Benchmark A53 5G Single Core 923 Multi Core 1721.S23 FE 5G Single Core 1721 Multi Core 4181.For me, I have never required a Data Card in any of my phones, therefore the lack of one in this one is not an issue.Cameras? I have never been a photographer or video creater therefore they are adequate for my needs, perhaps documenting that the wrong item was sent or a package arrived damaged."
,5,Wife loves it,Bought for wife and she loves it.
,4,Does not work with Spectrum wireless service.,Phone does not port with Spectrum wireless service.
,4,I replaced my Galaxy A50 after 3 years.,"I was able to copy over almost everything from my old phone seemlessly.Its faster, doesnt drop calls in certain areas, and has more memory.Enjoying my Black Friday deal $200 off.Best Buy had the same deal but if you open the box and dont like it theres a $45 restocking fee.Go with Amazon.Its not neccessary to spend so much on a good phone."
,4,Not supported by all carriers!,Love the phone but had to switch carriers. It is not compatible with xfinity mobile.
,4,good value,"the design is weird. the edges are sharp and the cameras stick out too far, so you HAVE to get a case to make it feel right. feels heavier than my S20 FE. I'd like them to bring back the SD card but that seems like wishful thinking. the snapdragon is one generation behind and lacks AV1 decoding. no wall charger in box. otherwise you're getting the typical good value out of a FE device. battery lasts a long time and the samsung dex always impresses people when I hijack their smart tvs."
,4,Batter goes down fast,"Phone was delivered fast,the only issue I have found is that the battery drain fast when it came I charged it at 100% didn't use it until the next day and it was at about 60% only issue I have found still playing around"
,3,It will be yellow after some months. It's just an eargel don't expect anymore,"If you are planning to buy it, I can guess you have bought an ""extraordinary"" Jawbone. I don't know if Jabra and Jawbone are a society but it is the only one option you have to get the handsfree in your ear.I think there are several ways you can use this gel to keep your headphones comfortable in your ear, however it has to be perfectly round and inch of diameter and no more than five milimeters of depth.If you are planning to buy them because you are planning to use it with a ""wonderful"" Jawbone, please consider other market options for BT handsfree.However if you have a very unconfortable and little headphones or an already bought Jawbone, it would be your unique solution. But maybe you won't ever need it if you look for a better BT handsfree device."
,5,It is a surge protector,"What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system, isolated devices and so on that do not need a big strip."
,1,Does not work,"According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices."
,1,Cheap along with poor customer service,"I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!"
,2,There is more to this story ...,"I am the author of an article for ""The Skeptical Inquirer"" about the origins of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about ""The Mothman Prophecies"" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
,1,Save your money--buy something else.,"I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support ""if you are still having trouble."" I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer. HP no longer means quality!!!"
,1,disappointed,"I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response."
,3,Major Installation Problem,"Since I had a Visioneer One Touch already installed on my computer (The reason I bought this one is that the last one died. I got great service from the previous one.), I assumed the installation would go without a hitch. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. To date, I have been unsuccessful in installing the software and the scanner is sitting on my desk with my ""in box"" on top of it. I haven't had the time to sit on the phone, going through the long ""automated"" help menus.I haven't given up yet, but neither do I have a working scanner!"
,1,First and Last,"This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk"
,2,Headphone jack,"I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?"
,1,Not a fan,"I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all."
,3,Not the best quality,"I bought this CD player because it was reasonably priced but I probably would have been better off buying a portable cd player with am/fm raido with a headphone jack. When I left the anti-skip protection off, it skips at the slightest move. I also found that if I turned the anti-skip protection on, the sound quality isn't as good."
,4,Some things not scifi anymore,"Think about the episode in the beginning when Matt's phone rings in the middle of a crowd. ""So what, his parents called his cellphone"" you may say. However, this was just pure fantasy in 1948."
,5,Best Ever,"Installation was straightforward. Programminng from the included mapping cd was easy. The Zumo finds position faster than my iWay. If you dedide to alter your programmed route it recalculates very quickly to get you to your destination. It is easy to see and easy to read, The music downloaded to the unit from iTunes sounds good through the headset and I can use the Bluetooth to answer my cellphone if necessary. It also looks good on the bike. I have no complaints at all. Great unit and worth the pricey cost."
,4,What an eye opener!,"It's the world we live in. Internet, cellphone, cable tv, facebook, work, school, etc. We try and cram so many things into our day thinking we are being productive, yet we are wreaking havoc on our bodies. Read this book and I think you will be fascinated by what you learn, and I think you will enjoy what you do for yourself after reading."
,1,Nokia CA--42 Compatible USB Data Cable,"I received my product in a timely manner. According to the Nokia website this cable is the one designed for my cellphone. However,I am not able to down load my pictures taken by my Nokia cellphone onto my computer using thie cable I ordered. I don't know why, the message I get from my computer is that the cellphone is not connected, when in fact it is connected.SincerelyTerry Elbin"
,1,Boring,"I thought the video would show them doing the actual bike riding, as in helmet cams or the such but nope.The camera men had to often hunt down the bikers as they didn't take cellphones/walkie talkies with them (cells wouldn't work in most areas I'm sure).Extremely boring video. Had high hopes."
,2,Challenged in a Convertible,"Pros: small and comfortable; quiet in low ambient noiseCons: noisy at speeds; fiddly to put onLooking for a Bluetooth headset I could use driving in my convertible, I researched and bought several last summer. The Cardo Scala 700 was great in the house, but not so good in the car, which is my primary use (thus biasing my rating). I put up a page with some MP3 noise tests at http://SeizeTruth.com/Tech/CellPhoneHeadsets"
,2,"sadly, it breaks easily","it was good while it lasted, after 30 days or so,one day while trying to pull the cellphone out, it just snap and broke. it's not a very strong material and it doesn't protect the cellphone 'that' much."
,2,Is Kinsey ready for retirement?,"Just because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, doesn't mean this series has to run till the bitter end! Especially since at the halfway mark Kinsey seems to be running out of steam. The pace is lackadaisical at best, and the plot is far from original. Neither Grafton nor Kinsey show much interest, so how do they expect the readers to?And if there are future episodes (I know ""O"" is already in the bookstores), then PLEASE give Kinsey a computer, cellphone, etc. Bring this woman into the 21st century! It's ridiculous to still have her searching for phone booths."
,1,Don't Support Palm Vaporware,"All the extra PDA features this phone provides are nice. The only problem is that it is not a phone.A phone will ring when someone calls you, not reboot.A phone will not go into voice mail immediately and not notify the user.You don't have to place a phone on speakerphone in order to hear what the other person is saying.When making a call, a cellphone will not crash 50% of the time.For some reason the reciever on this phone will decide when it does or doesn't actually want to work.Who cares whether or not your phone can play movies, if it can't even make a proper call. Palm promised a patch to fix all these issues, which took them 6 monthes, and still there is no change. This will be the last Palm product I buy. The cost alone is the only reason I haven't taken a hammer to it."
,3,Yeah but what about all tailgators and bad drivers???,"This is all fine and good but what about the road racers, tailgaters and cellphoners?Isn't some of our Ire a reaction to stupdity???"
,5,S23fe,Great photos as always.
,5,Really worth the price,"I'm currently using this phone as of typing this review and so far there is no issues with this phone and its worth the price when it's on sale for less than $500 it handles really well with gaming and pictures so this makes it worth the price. I can game at 120 fps and experience a 120 refresh rate and it feels like a powerful phone for this price. So if your in the market of finding a budget phone for at least $500, get this phone while it's on sale. You won't regret it"
,5,Fabulous upgrade from Galaxy A52.,"My A52 was getting a bit old and had limited updates to the OS.I decided to splurge and get something close to a premium version just to see what it was like and if it was worth the extra money.I'm not a power user and seldom take advantage of the camera, but in general I found the S23 FE to be a significant improvement over the A52.It has all the features I wanted in waterproofing, wireless charging, 5G, etc., but the think I like most is the display.The colors on a black background just pop out at you."
,5,All good and a very good price.,"Upgraded from a S9+, so this is a noticeable improvement for a very good price."
,5,Fine phone,Faster along with more memory.
,4,Great phone with a horrible battery,"This phone is fast and the camera is the best I have had, however, it runs out of battery just sitting there overnight. I don't know if I got a dud battery or a returned phone, but it is horrible. I have never had a phone with such a bad battery right out of the box."
,5,Impresionante,Es un teléfono realmente bueno es rápido y lo que más me impresiono el la calidad de imagen tanto que lo utilizo como una wwbcam para mis videos ya que tiene mucha más resolución que una webcam
,5,Long battery life and awesome night time cameras and stuff.,"Like everything. It's better than crapple iphones, they suck."
,4,Pretty cool,I like it.
,5,Excellent,Phone was a little thicker than I thought it would be but overall it's lovely excellent photos and many editing options long battery life.. can last for 2days with average use. Face recognition doesnt work well but finger print is excellent Overall I'm happy
,4,Very nice,Needed a new up to date phone. So far so good. Does everything that I was looking for from my “helpers“ in choosing.
